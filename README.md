# Auto-CECFST

The program 'Auto-CECFST' could automaticaly establish FE models of concrete-encased concrete-filled steel tubular(CFST) structures based on a Python and ABAQUS platform. It requires only essential geometric parameters and physical parameters. When users perform auto modeling, you just need to input the necessary geometric and physical parameters of the model. After clicking the "Preview" button, a cross-sectional diagram corresponding to the geometric dimensions of the input model can be seen, which could help check the model. After clicking the "Modeling" button, the model will be automatically established. Then, a user-named folder will be generated, which contains the cae file and inp file of the built model.

Notes: The suitable ABAQUS version is from 6.14 to 2022.
