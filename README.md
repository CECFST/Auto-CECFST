# Auto-CECFST
The program 'Auto-CECFST' could automatically establish FE models of concrete-encased concrete-filled steel tubular(CFST) structures based on a Python and ABAQUS platform. It requires only essential geometric parameters and physical parameters. When users perform auto-modelling, they just need to input the necessary geometric and physical parameters of the model. After clicking the "Preview" button, a cross-sectional diagram corresponding to the geometric dimensions of the input model can be seen, which could help check the model. After clicking the "Modeling" button, the model will be automatically established. Then, a user-named folder will be generated, which contains the cae file and inp file of the built model.
Please quote relevant papers later if this program works in your research. The author would be glad to hear from the users(Email: madanyang@buaa.edu.cn)

Notes: The suitable ABAQUS version is from 6.14 to 2022.
